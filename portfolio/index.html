            <h2> Introduction</h2>
            Hello, my name is Becca Crosse, and welcome to my very first web design portfolio. I'm a 20 year old student studying my third year of my bachelor's degree at Stanford University. I identify as biracial and I'm hoping to double major in computer science and African and African American studies, before spending some time in the field and returning to get a master's degree in computer science. I'm from Portland Oregon, currently living in New York, NY and have a wide range of hobbies in addition to coding. Please enjoy these cute photosof kittens while I get some professional headshots taken.

        <p>I've only just begun learning web development at a self directed pace using online resources, so I'm still working out some of the more advanced features, but I wanted to show off what I've learned so far! In the above directory, you'll find examples of my work including an interactive form, a blog client example, and a calculator</p>

            My training in university has primarily dealt with backend engineering but I've long since had an interest in web design. Because of this I wanted to take this passion into my own hands and begin learning on the side of my actual studies. You may be wondering why I wouldn't just take a web design class at my university. The answer is this: I frankly wanted to experiment with how I experienced learning in a self paced and self regulated environment. While I don't have the assistance of a TA or professor on this journey, I also can suit my learning to my needs. I plan to compare this experience and my overall knowledge at the end of my web development journey. Nevertheless I wanted to show you the practice that I have accumulated thus far.ducimus
